## Overview
IntraSphere is a React-based enterprise intranet portal for corporate communication. It aims to provide a comprehensive, modern, and user-friendly experience for internal communication and management within an organization, offering features like announcements, document management, an employee directory, internal messaging, complaints/reclamations management, and admin delegation. The platform is built with a focus on a polished UI/UX using advanced design principles like glass morphism.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
